There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nprint(schools.head())\nprint(schools.info())\n\n# Which NYC schools have the best math results?\n# The best math results are at least 80% of the *maximum possible score of 800* for math.\n# Save your results in a pandas DataFrame called best_math_schools, including \"school_name\" and \"average_math\" columns, # sorted by \"average_math\" in descending order.\n\nmax_score = 800\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools['average_math'] >= (80/100) * max_score][['school_name', 'average_math']].sort_values(by='average_math', ascending=False)\nprint(best_math_schools)\n\n# What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\n# Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called top_10_schools containing the \"school_name\" and a new column named \"total_SAT\", with results ordered by \"total_SAT\" in descending order (\"total_SAT\" being the sum of math, reading, and writing scores).\n\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']].sort_values(by='total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\nprint(top_10_schools)\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\n# Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called largest_std_dev.\n# The DataFrame should contain one row, with:\n# \"borough\" -
